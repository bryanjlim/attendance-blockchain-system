# attendance-blockchain-system

A web service for clubs and organizations at Issaquah High School to take attendance and export attendance data. It also happens to utlize a blockchain (that is not decentralized yet). <br />

Uses ReactJS and crypto-js <br />

Components: 
-	The attendance blockchain to store attendance data
-	The web interface to add a new block to the blockchain <br />
    o	Will also be able to view and export data for a specific club on a specific date
-	The database (which will store the blockchain) <br />
    o	We do not currently have nodes or mine, and will be simply using MongoDB. If someone tampers with the data, the blockchain will be able to detect it due to a mismatch in a current or previous blockâ€™s expected and current hash. We do not expect high school students to go through the trouble of recalculating the hashes of every block just to modify attendance records. 

Why?
-	Attendance records are easily tampered with as they are modifiable. Using a blockchain to store attendance data will ensure accurate records due to its immutability.
-	Clubs currently use Google Forms to keep track of attendance, many times creating a new one for each meeting. This seems inefficient and clutters Google Drive space. We can do better. <br />
    o	Google Forms data is hard to sort through if a club holds all their attendance in one form. We will enable them to sort through and export their data more efficiently.
-	A learning experience for high school students to experiment while creating a usable attendance system.
